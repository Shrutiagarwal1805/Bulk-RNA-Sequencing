# Bulk RNA Sequencing Data Analysis using DESeq2

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data using the DESeq2 package in R. The analysis includes data preprocessing, normalization, differential expression analysis, and visualization of results.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Import and clean raw count data.
- **Normalization**: Use DESeq2 to normalize count data.
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify differentially expressed genes between conditions.
- **Visualization**: Generate plots for data exploration and results interpretation, including MA plots, heatmaps, and PCA plots.

## Installation

To run this analysis, you need to have R and the following packages installed:

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
BiocManager::install("ggplot2")
BiocManager::install("pheatmap")
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data**: Ensure your count data is in a matrix format with genes as rows and samples as columns.

2. **Run the analysis**: Use the provided R scripts to perform the analysis.


- [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) for differential expression analysis.
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for data visualization.
- [pheatmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html) for heatmap generation.
